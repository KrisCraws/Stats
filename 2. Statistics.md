# Statistics
<br>

***population*** 
- collection of all items of interest
- denoted N
- numbers we obtain when working with a population are 'parameters'

***sample***
- subset of the population
- denoted n
- numbers we obtain when working with a population are 'statistics'
- Needs
  <ul> 
      - randomness: random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance <br>
      - representativeness: representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population <br>
  </ul>

### Types of Data
1. Categorical: categories or groups, yes/no questions  
2. Numerical:
    <ul>
        <a. discrete - finite (ex. number of children you want to have) <br>
        b. continuous 0 infinite (ex. human's weight)
    </ul>


***Pareto diagram*** - ordered by frequencies and then there is a line that totals the cumulative frequency. On the right axis it has the %

generally, statisticians prefer 5 to 20 intervals to work with. can use ((largest value - smallest value)/number of desired intervals)

***relative frequency*** is made up of percentages

### Measures of Central Tendency
mean, median, and mode
<br>

### Skewness
- Right skewness means that the tail goes off to the right
- zero skew or symmetrical

***variance*** - measures the dispersion of a set of data points around their mean
- gives results in squared units

***standard deviation*** - square root of the variance squared
- most common measure of variability for a single set

***coefficient of variation*** - standard deviation / mean
- relative standard deviation (bc its simply the standard deviation relative to the mean)
- there are no units. it is perfect for comparisons.

***correlation coefficient*** - Cov(x,y) / (Stdev(x) * Stdev(y))
- correlation coeff. of 1 means the entire variability of one variable is explained by the other
- correlation of 0 means they have nothing in common
- correlation of x and y is the same as correlation of y and x

<br>

  Correlation does not imply causation <br>
  ***A common practice is to disregard correlations below 0.2***

  # Inferential Statistics Fundamentals

  ***Discrete uniform distribution*** - all outcomes have an equal chance of occuring

  ***normal distribution*** - also called the Gaussian distribution and some people call it a bell curve <br> 
  - mean, median and mode are all equal <br>
  - has no skew
  - notation: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}(\mu ,\sigma ^{2})}

Every distribution can be standardized. Standardization is the process of transforming the variable into one with a mean of 0 and a std dev of 1 <br>

We can also standardize a normal distribution -> the result is a standard normal distribution

# Central Limit Theorem

***def*** : no matter the underlying distribution, the sampling distribution approcimates a normal; usually in order to apply this we need at least 30 observations (n>30)

-CLT allows us to perform tests, solve problems and make inferences using the Normal distribution, even when the population is not normally distributed 

### Reasons to use the normal distribution
- They approximate a wide variety of random variables
- distributions of sample means with large neough sample sizes could be approximated as normal
- all computable statitistics are elegant
- decisions based on normal distribution insights have a good track record

# Standard Error
***def*** : the standard deviation of the distribution formed by the sample means

- standard error decreases when sample size increases
